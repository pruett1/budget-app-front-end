Prompt to stub UI

### Modify this to stub out a front end for a budget app in IOS 26

The app should contain
1. landing page that prompts login or create account
   i. if the user clicks create account then redirect to create account page
   ii. the login page should have a forgot password that will redirect to a forgot password page
2. once the user has logged in they should be greeted by a page that has tabs along the bottom
    i. the bulk of this page should be an overview dashboard that will be populated (via an api call) with their net worth at a glance, info about budget adherance/remaining amount allowed to spend that month, and the top 3 spending categories
    ii. the tabs should be for Overview (currently selected), Budget, Investments, Cash, and Account
3. The Budget page should have
    i. a button to create/edit current budget
    ii. a breakdown of the current budget (50/30/20 etc.) in a pie chart
    iii. a flowchart that shows the current breakdown of income for the month and spending per category
4. The investments page should have
   i. the current total value of investments and breakdown by account when that is tapped
   ii. historical graph of investments value and comparison to S&P 500 with percent change
   iii. the graph should be able to have the view changed between 1mo, 6mo, 1yr, all, and YTD
5. The cash page should have
   i. the current total value of all cash and breakdown by account when that is tapped
   ii. historical graph of cash value
6. Account
   i. The account page should have a button to connect more financial accounts (this will be handled with via Plaid)
   ii. Update personal information
   iii. Toggle light/dark mode
   iv. Logout

For the tech stack you will be using SwiftUI, and will be pulling the relevant account information via API requests (for now mock data and add TODO comments where API calls should go), the information that will be stored locally currently is a session token that the API will send back when the login first occurs

For color scheme main two colors
Light Mode:
RGB(255, 255, 255)
RGB(133, 187, 101)

Dark mode:
RGB(27, 33, 26)
RGB(16, 90, 55)
